## Running the Application

Double-click the executable file to launch the clock. The application will display the current time with a visually pleasing background that changes over time.

## Verifying the Digital Signature

To ensure the integrity and authenticity of the executable, follow these steps to verify its digital signature:

1. **Right-click** on the executable file.
2. Select **Properties**.
3. Go to the **Digital Signatures** tab.
   - Click the timestamp date **Saturday**.
4. Click on **Details**.
   - Click **View Certificate**.
5. Click **Install Certificate**.

- [jpb1991](https://github.com/jpb1991) providing the example code then i enhanced it
- this is his code below:
```python
import pygame
import sys
from datetime import datetime

# Initialize Pygame
pygame.init()

# Set up display
width, height = 500, 250
screen = pygame.display.set_mode((width, height), pygame.RESIZABLE)
pygame.display.set_caption("Local Time Clock")

# Define colors
background_color = (240, 240, 240)  # Light gray background
text_color = (0, 0, 0)  # Black text
shadow_color = (50, 50, 50)  # Gray shadow for text

# Load a system font
font = pygame.font.SysFont('segoeui', 72)  # You can change 'segoeui' to 'arial' if needed

# Clock for refreshing the screen
clock = pygame.time.Clock()

def draw_text_with_shadow(surface, text, font, text_color, shadow_color, position):
    text_surface = font.render(text, True, text_color)
    shadow_surface = font.render(text, True, shadow_color)
    text_rect = text_surface.get_rect(center=position)
    shadow_rect = shadow_surface.get_rect(center=(position[0] + 2, position[1] + 2))
    surface.blit(shadow_surface, shadow_rect)
    surface.blit(text_surface, text_rect)

while True:
    for event in pygame.event.get():
        if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
            pygame.quit()
            sys.exit()

    # Get the current local time and date
    current_time = datetime.now().strftime("%H:%M:%S")
    current_date = datetime.now().strftime("%A, %d %B %Y")

    # Draw background, time, and date with shadows
    screen.fill(background_color)
    draw_text_with_shadow(screen, current_time, font, text_color, shadow_color, (width // 2, height // 2 - 30))
    draw_text_with_shadow(screen, current_date, font, text_color, shadow_color, (width // 2, height // 2 + 40))

    # Update the display
    pygame.display.flip()

    # Cap the frame rate to limit updates to once per second
    clock.tick(1)
```
